```

## Planning a Milestone

### Step 1: Create Milestone Structure

```bash
# Create milestone directory
mkdir .simone/02_REQUIREMENTS/M##_Milestone_Name

# Example:
mkdir .simone/02_REQUIREMENTS/M01_User_Authentication
```

### Step 2: Define Milestone Metadata

Create `M##_META.md` using the milestone template:

```yaml
milestone_id: "M01"
milestone_name: "User Authentication System"
start_date: "2024-01-15"
target_date: "2024-03-15"
status: "planning"
priority: "high"
business_value: "critical"
technical_complexity: "high"
estimated_effort: 8  # person-weeks
team_size: 3
completion_percentage: 0
success_metrics:
  primary_metric: "User login success rate"
  target_values: ["99.9% uptime", "<2s login time", "0 security vulnerabilities"]
dependencies:
  external: ["Auth provider API", "SSL certificates"]
  internal: ["Database setup", "Frontend framework"]
risk_assessment:
  overall_risk_level: "medium"
  primary_risks: ["Third-party API reliability", "Security compliance"]
  mitigation_strategies: ["Implement fallback auth", "Security audit"]
```

### Step 3: Define Requirements

Create requirement documents in the milestone directory:

1. **Product Requirements (M##_PRD.md)**:
   - User stories and acceptance criteria
   - Business objectives and success metrics
   - User experience requirements
   - Non-functional requirements

2. **Technical Specifications (M##_SPECS.md)**:
   - System architecture changes
   - API specifications
   - Database schema updates
   - Integration requirements

3. **Additional Documents** as needed:
   - `M##_Security_Requirements.md`
   - `M##_Performance_Targets.md`
   - `M##_Migration_Plan.md`

### Step 3.5: AI-Enhanced Requirements Analysis with Cognitive Personas

Leverage specialized AI personas to validate and enhance your milestone requirements:

security_assessment: "OAuth 2.0 with PKCE required for security compliance"
performance_considerations: "Response time target: <200ms for auth endpoints"
quality_insights: "90% test coverage required for authentication flows"
complexity_analysis: "High complexity due to third-party integrations"
```

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Use `--introspect` flag to see the AI reasoning process and learn from expert analysis patterns.

### Step 4: Capacity Planning

Calculate team capacity and resource allocation:

```markdown
## Capacity Planning

### Team Allocation
- Backend Developer: 100% (8 weeks)
- Frontend Developer: 75% (6 weeks)
- DevOps Engineer: 50% (4 weeks)
- **Total Capacity**: 18 person-weeks

### Resource Requirements
- Development environments: 3
- Staging environment: 1
- Third-party services: Auth0, SendGrid
- Budget allocation: $15,000
```

## Breaking Down Milestones

### Step 1: Identify Major Components

Analyze the milestone to identify major work streams:

```markdown
## Work Breakdown Structure

### 1. Backend Authentication (40%)
- User model and database schema
- Authentication API endpoints
- Session management
- Password reset flow
- OAuth integration

### 2. Frontend Integration (30%)
- Login/signup forms
- Session handling
- Protected routes
- User profile management

### 3. Infrastructure & Security (30%)
- SSL setup and configuration
- Security hardening
- Monitoring and logging
- Performance optimization
```

### Step 2: Create Sprints from Milestone

Use the Simone command to generate sprints:

```
/project:simone:create_sprints_from_milestone M01
```

This will:
1. Analyze milestone scope and complexity
2. Create optimal sprint structure (typically 2-week sprints)
3. Distribute work across sprints
4. Set up sprint directories and metadata

Example sprint breakdown:
```
.simone/03_SPRINTS/
├── S01_M01_Backend_Core/
│   ├── S01_META.md
│   └── S01_TASKS.md
├── S02_M01_Frontend_Integration/
│   ├── S02_META.md
│   └── S02_TASKS.md
└── S03_M01_Security_Polish/
    ├── S03_META.md
    └── S03_TASKS.md
```

### Step 3: Create Detailed Tasks

For each sprint, create specific tasks:

```
/project:simone:create_sprint_tasks S01 "Implement user model and database schema"
/project:simone:create_sprint_tasks S01 "Create authentication API endpoints"
/project:simone:create_sprint_tasks S01 "Implement JWT token generation"
```

## Executing Milestones

### Progress Tracking

Update milestone metadata regularly:

```yaml
completion_percentage: 35
current_sprint: "S02"
completed_features:
  - "User registration API"
  - "Login functionality"
  - "Database schema implementation"
active_blockers:
  - "OAuth provider setup delayed"
  - "Performance issues with session storage"
```

### Status Monitoring

Use the status command for milestone overview:

```
/project:simone:status milestone M01
```

Output includes:
- Overall progress percentage
- Sprint completion status
- Risk assessment updates
- Blocker identification
- Resource utilization

### Risk Management

Continuously update risk assessment:

```yaml
risk_updates:
  - date: "2024-02-01"
    risk: "OAuth provider delays"
    impact: "high"
    mitigation: "Implement basic auth first, OAuth in next sprint"
  - date: "2024-02-15"
    risk: "Performance degradation"
    impact: "medium"
