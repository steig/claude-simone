## Welcome to Your First Simone Project! üöÄ

This interactive tutorial will guide you through creating your first Simone project from scratch. You'll learn the core concepts by actually building a real project structure.

**What You'll Build**: A simple "Personal Blog" project with milestones, sprints, and tasks  
**Time Required**: ~30 minutes  
**Skills Learned**: Project setup, milestone planning, task creation, and basic workflows

---

## üìã Prerequisites Checklist

Before we start, make sure you have:
- [ ] Simone Framework installed ([Installation Guide](../getting-started/installation.md))
- [ ] Basic command line knowledge
- [ ] A text editor (VS Code, Sublime, etc.)
- [ ] 30 minutes of focused time

**Quick Check**: Run this command to verify Simone is working:
```bash
ls .claude/commands/simone/
```
You should see a list of available Simone commands.

---

## üéØ Step 1: Create Your Project Directory

Let's start by creating a new directory for your blog project.

**Your Turn**:
```bash
# Create a new directory
mkdir my-blog-project
cd my-blog-project

# Verify you're in the right place
pwd
```

**Expected Output**: You should see the full path to your `my-blog-project` directory.

**‚úÖ Checkpoint**: You're now in your project directory. This will be the root of your Simone project.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Step 2: Initialize Simone Structure

Now we'll set up the basic Simone framework structure.

**Your Turn**:
```bash
# Initialize Simone project structure
# (This creates the .simone directory and basic structure)
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/simone/main/install-simone.sh | bash
```

**Alternative** (if you have the script locally):
```bash
# Copy the install script to your project
cp /path/to/simone/install-simone.sh .
bash install-simone.sh
```

**What Just Happened?**
- Created `.simone/` directory with organized subdirectories
- Set up basic project structure
- Created template files for project management

**‚úÖ Checkpoint**: Check that you now have a `.simone` directory:
```bash
ls -la .simone/
```

---

## üìù Step 3: Create Your Project Manifest

The project manifest is the "command center" of your Simone project. Let's create one for your blog.

**Your Turn**: Open `.simone/00_PROJECT_MANIFEST.md` in your text editor and replace the content with:

```markdown
# Personal Blog Project Manifest

---

## üß† Step 7: Experience Cognitive Personas

Now that you have concrete tasks, let's learn how to execute them with specialized AI expertise! Simone includes 9 cognitive personas that provide domain-specific guidance.

### Understanding Personas

Think of personas as specialized consultants that enhance your development process:

**üîí Security Expert**: "Always consider OWASP guidelines and threat models"  
**üèóÔ∏è Architect**: "Focus on scalable design patterns and system integration"  
**üé® Frontend Specialist**: "Prioritize user experience and accessibility"  
**‚öôÔ∏è Backend Engineer**: "Optimize APIs and database performance"  

### Hands-On Persona Experience

**Your Turn**: Let's enhance our blog project tasks with persona expertise!

#### 1. Create a Security-Enhanced Task

Create a new authentication task with security expertise:

```bash
# In your terminal, create a security-focused task
cat > .simone/03_SPRINTS/S01_M01_Blog_Foundation/task_002_user_authentication.md << 'EOF'
---
task_id: "TASK_002"
title: "Implement User Authentication"
sprint_id: "S01_M01"
milestone_id: "M01"
type: "feature"
priority: "high"
complexity: "medium"
estimated_hours: 8
status: "todo"
assigned_to: "Developer"

# Cognitive Personas Applied
personas_applied: ["security", "backend"]
security_requirements: "OWASP compliance, JWT tokens, secure password hashing"
backend_considerations: "RESTful API design, session management, database security"
---

# TASK_002: Implement User Authentication

**Enhanced with Security + Backend Personas**

## Security-First Approach

### Security Requirements (Security Persona)
- [ ] Implement bcrypt password hashing (min cost factor 12)
- [ ] Add rate limiting for login attempts (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- [ ] Implement JWT tokens with secure claims
- [ ] Add HTTPS enforcement and secure cookie settings
- [ ] Include password strength validation

### Backend Implementation (Backend Persona)  
- [ ] Design RESTful authentication endpoints
- [ ] Implement proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Create middleware for protected routes
- [ ] Optimize database queries for user lookup

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Security review passed
- [ ] Password security tested
- [ ] API security validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Acceptance Criteria

**Security-Enhanced Criteria**:
1. ‚úÖ Users can register with validated email addresses
2. ‚úÖ Passwords meet security requirements (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers)
3. ‚úÖ Login process includes brute force protection
4. ‚úÖ JWT tokens expire appropriately (15 min access, 7 day refresh)
5. ‚úÖ All authentication endpoints return consistent error messages
6. ‚úÖ Security headers implemented (CSRF, XSS protection)

**Implementation Notes**:
- Security persona ensures OWASP compliance from day one
- Backend persona optimizes API design and database interactions  
- Combined expertise prevents common security vulnerabilities
EOF
```

#### 2. Try Different Persona Combinations

**Your Turn**: Experiment with persona-enhanced task execution:

```bash
# Security-focused development for authentication
/project:simone:do_task TASK_002 --persona-security --persona-backend --introspect

# The --introspect flag shows you the AI reasoning process:
# ü§î Security Thinking: "JWT implementation needs secure signing algorithm"
# üéØ Backend Decision: "Use HS256 with 256-bit secret for development"
# üîç Analysis: "Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks"
# ‚úÖ Conclusion: "Implementation follows OWASP authentication guidelines"
```

#### 3. Create Frontend Task with UX Focus

**Your Turn**: Create a UI task enhanced with frontend expertise:

```bash
cat > .simone/03_SPRINTS/S01_M01_Blog_Foundation/task_003_responsive_design.md << 'EOF'
---
task_id: "TASK_003"
title: "Create Responsive Blog Layout"
type: "feature"
priority: "medium"
complexity: "medium"
estimated_hours: 6

# Multi-Persona Enhancement
personas_applied: ["frontend", "performance", "qa"]
ux_considerations: "Mobile-first design, accessibility compliance"
performance_targets: "Loading time <2s, optimized images"
quality_standards: "Cross-browser testing, accessibility audit"
---

# TASK_003: Create Responsive Blog Layout

**Enhanced with Frontend + Performance + QA Personas**

## Quality Assurance (QA Persona)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Accessibility testing with screen readers
- [ ] Performance testing on 3G networks
- [ ] Visual regression testing
EOF
```

#### 4. Experience Multi-Persona Analysis

**Your Turn**: Try the comprehensive analysis approach:

```bash
# Multi-persona consultation for complex decisions
/project:simone:create_milestone "User Management System" --persona-security --persona-backend --persona-frontend --consensus

# What happens:
# - Security persona identifies compliance requirements
# - Backend persona designs scalable data architecture  
# - Frontend persona plans user experience flows
# - Consensus mode validates decisions across all perspectives
```

### Persona Learning Outcomes

After this step, you understand:

- ‚úÖ **Domain Expertise**: How different personas approach the same problem
- ‚úÖ **Quality Enhancement**: How personas prevent common mistakes upfront  
- ‚úÖ **Learning Acceleration**: How mentor persona helps team growth
- ‚úÖ **Cost Optimization**: How UltraCompressed mode reduces AI costs
- ‚úÖ **Transparent AI**: How introspection mode shows reasoning

### When to Use Personas
