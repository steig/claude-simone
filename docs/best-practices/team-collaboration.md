5. **Continuous Improvement**: Learn from every interaction

### Team Dynamics

```yaml
# .simone/teams/collaboration-charter.yml
team_charter:
  vision: |
    Build exceptional software through collaborative excellence
    
  values:
    - "Open and honest communication"
    - "Shared ownership of outcomes"
    - "Learning from failures"
    - "Celebrating successes"

```

## Communication Strategies

### Synchronous Communication

#### Daily Standups

**Purpose**: Alignment and blocker identification

```yaml
daily_standup:
  time: "9:30 AM"
  duration: "15 minutes max"
  format: "Round-robin"
  
  questions:
    - "What did I complete yesterday?"
    - "What will I work on today?"
    - "What blockers do I have?"
    
  best_practices:
    - Keep updates brief (1-2 minutes per person)
    - Focus on work, not detailed technical discussions
    - Note blockers for follow-up after standup
    - Use parking lot for deeper discussions
    
  remote_tips:
    - Use video when possible
    - Have a written backup in team channel
    - Rotate meeting leadership
    - Time-box rigorously
```

#### Sprint Ceremonies

**Planning Sessions**

```yaml
sprint_planning:
  duration: "2 hours for 2-week sprint"
  
  agenda:
    - review_previous_sprint: "15 minutes"
    - present_sprint_goal: "10 minutes"
    - story_review_and_sizing: "60 minutes"
    - capacity_planning: "20 minutes"
    - commitment: "15 minutes"
    
  preparation:
    - Product owner has prioritized backlog
    - Stories have acceptance criteria
    - Technical spikes completed
    - Dependencies identified
    
  outputs:
    - Sprint goal documented
    - Stories assigned and estimated
    - Capacity confirmed
    - Risks identified
```

**Retrospectives**

```yaml
retrospective:
  frequency: "End of each sprint"
  duration: "90 minutes"
  
  formats:
    - "Start, Stop, Continue"
    - "4 L's: Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed for"
    - "Sailboat: Wind, Anchors, Rocks"
    
  process:
    - Set the stage: "5 minutes"
    - Gather data: "20 minutes"
    - Generate insights: "25 minutes"
    - Decide actions: "25 minutes"
    - Close: "15 minutes"
    
  follow_up:
    - Document action items
    - Assign owners
    - Review in next retro
    - Share learnings with wider team
```
