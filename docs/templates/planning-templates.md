claude-code "/project:simone:create_plan --type=roadmap --horizon=12months"

# Initialize sprint planning
claude-code "/project:simone:plan_sprint --number=43 --duration=2weeks"

# Generate capacity report
claude-code "/project:simone:analyze_capacity --team=engineering --period=Q1"

# Create project kickoff
claude-code "/project:simone:kickoff_project --name='Mobile App'"
```

### Template Customization

1. **Extend existing templates**:
   ```yaml
   # Add custom fields to any template
   custom_fields:
     compliance_review: "required"
     sustainability_impact: "assessed"
   ```

2. **Create organization-specific templates**:
   ```bash
   cp .claude/templates/simone/planning/sprint-plan.yml \
      .simone/templates/planning/agile-sprint.yml
   ```

3. **Template inheritance**:
   ```yaml
   metadata:
     extends: "sprint-plan"
     custom_version: "1.0"
   ```
