## Using Task Templates

### Creating a Task from Template

```bash
# Create a new feature task
claude-code "/project:simone:create_task --template=feature --title='Add user notifications'"

# Create a bug fix task
claude-code "/project:simone:create_task --template=bug-fix --priority=critical"

# Create a research task
claude-code "/project:simone:create_task --template=research --timebox='3 days'"
```

### Customizing Templates

1. **Copy existing template**:
   ```bash
   cp .claude/templates/simone/tasks/feature.yml \
      .simone/templates/tasks/custom-feature.yml
   ```

2. **Modify for your needs**:
   ```yaml
   # Add custom fields
   custom_fields:
     business_value: "high"
     stakeholder: "@product-owner"
     market_impact: "description"
   ```

3. **Use custom template**:
   ```bash
   claude-code "/project:simone:create_task --template=custom-feature"
   ```

## Template Best Practices

### 1. Complete All Sections

Don't leave template sections empty. If not applicable, explicitly state "N/A" with reasoning.

### 2. Be Specific

- Use concrete examples
- Include measurable success criteria
- Define clear acceptance criteria

### 3. Link Dependencies

Always identify and link:
- Blocking dependencies
- Related tasks
- Required resources

### 4. Estimate Realistically

Include time for:
- Development
- Testing
- Code review
- Documentation
- Deployment

### 5. Consider Edge Cases

For each task type, consider:
- Error scenarios
- Performance implications
- Security concerns
- User experience impact

## Template Validation

The Simone Framework validates templates for:

- Required fields presence
- Data type correctness
- Reference validity
- Estimation reasonableness

Run validation:
```bash
claude-code "/project:simone:validate_task --file=TASK-001.yml"
```

## Integration with Workflow

### Sprint Planning

Templates integrate with sprint planning:
```yaml
sprint_planning:
  task_selection:
    - Review template completeness
    - Verify estimations
    - Check dependencies
    - Assign to team members
```

### Progress Tracking

Track task progress:
```yaml
progress_tracking:
  states:
    - not_started
    - in_progress
    - blocked
    - in_review
    - completed
    
  updates:
    - Daily status updates
    - Blocker identification
    - Time tracking
```

### Quality Gates

Templates enforce quality:
```yaml
quality_gates:
  before_start:
    - Dependencies resolved
    - Acceptance criteria clear
    - Resources available
    
  before_complete:
    - All criteria met
    - Tests passing
    - Documentation updated
    - Code reviewed
```

## Conclusion

Task templates in the Simone Framework provide structure and consistency while remaining flexible enough to accommodate various project needs. By using these templates, teams ensure that all necessary information is captured, work is properly estimated, and quality standards are maintained throughout the development process.
