      - System design
      - Technical decisions
      - Architecture reviews
      
  qa:
    lead: "@emily.brown"
    members:
      - "@david.lee"
    responsibilities:
      - Test planning
      - Quality assurance
      - Release validation
```

### 2. Initialize Team Repository

```bash
# Clone the framework
git clone https://github.com/steig/claude-steig.git
cd your-project

# Initialize Simone for your project
claude-code "/project:simone:init"

# Set up team configuration
claude-code "/project:simone:configure_teams"
```

### 3. Configure Access Controls

Create access control policies in `.simone/governance/access-control.yml`:

```yaml
access_control:
  repositories:
    production:
      write: ["engineering-lead", "architecture-lead"]
      review_required: 2
      protected_branches: ["main", "release/*"]
    
    development:
      write: ["all-developers"]
      review_required: 1
      
  approvals:
    architecture_changes:
      required_approvers: ["@architecture-team"]
      minimum_approvals: 1
      
    production_deployment:
      required_approvers: ["@engineering-lead", "@qa-lead"]
      minimum_approvals: 2
```

## Governance Structure

### 1. Decision Making Framework

Establish clear decision-making processes using ADRs (Architecture Decision Records):

```bash
# Create an ADR for a technical decision
claude-code "/project:simone:create_adr" \
  --title="Microservices Architecture" \
  --status="proposed" \
  --decision="Adopt microservices for core platform" \
  --team="@architecture"
```

### 2. Review Processes

Configure mandatory review processes in `.simone/governance/review-policy.yml`:

```yaml
review_policies:
  code_review:
    minimum_reviewers: 2
    require_team_lead_approval: true
    auto_assign_reviewers: true
    review_checklist:
      - Code quality standards met
      - Tests included and passing
      - Documentation updated
      - Security considerations addressed
      
  architecture_review:
    trigger_on:
      - "changes to */architecture/*"
      - "new service creation"
      - "database schema changes"
    required_reviewers: ["@architecture-team"]
```

### 3. Compliance and Audit Trails

Enable comprehensive audit logging:

```bash
# Configure audit logging
claude-code "/project:simone:configure_audit" \
  --log-level="detailed" \
  --retention="90days" \
  --compliance="SOC2,ISO27001"
```

## Workflow Integration

### 1. Sprint Planning

Set up sprint planning workflow for teams:

```bash
# Create a new sprint
claude-code "/project:simone:create_sprint" \
  --milestone="Q1-2025" \
  --duration="2weeks" \
  --team="engineering" \
  --capacity="160hours"
```

### 2. Task Distribution

Configure automatic task distribution based on team expertise:

```yaml
# .simone/workflows/task-distribution.yml
task_distribution:
  algorithm: "skill-based"
  factors:
    - expertise_area
    - current_workload
    - priority_level
    
  skill_mapping:
    frontend:
      primary: ["@jane.smith", "@mike.wilson"]
      secondary: ["@john.doe"]
      
    backend:
      primary: ["@alex.chen", "@john.doe"]
      secondary: ["@jane.smith"]
      
    infrastructure:
      primary: ["@sarah.johnson"]
      secondary: ["@alex.chen"]
```

### 3. Progress Tracking

Set up dashboards and reporting:

```bash
# Generate team dashboard
claude-code "/project:simone:generate_dashboard" \
  --type="team-progress" \
  --period="current-sprint" \
  --metrics="velocity,burndown,quality"
```

## Best Practices for Enterprise Teams

### 1. Standardized Development Process

Create standardized templates for common tasks:

```bash
# Set up enterprise templates
claude-code "/project:simone:install_templates" \
  --package="enterprise-standard" \
  --customize="company-specific"
```

### 2. Knowledge Management

Establish knowledge sharing practices:

```yaml
# .simone/knowledge/sharing-policy.yml
knowledge_sharing:
  documentation:
    required_for:
      - New features
      - API changes
      - Architecture decisions
      
  knowledge_sessions:
    frequency: "weekly"
    format: "tech-talks"
    recording: true
    
  mentorship:
    junior_dev_pairing: true
    code_review_learning: true
```

### 3. Quality Gates

Implement automated quality gates:

```bash
# Configure quality gates
claude-code "/project:simone:configure_quality_gates" \
  --code-coverage="80%" \
  --security-scan="required" \
  --performance-baseline="defined" \
  --documentation="mandatory"
```

## Multi-Team Coordination

### 1. Cross-Team Dependencies

Manage dependencies between teams:

```yaml
# .simone/coordination/dependencies.yml
dependencies:
  frontend_team:
    depends_on:
      - api_team: 
          contracts: ["user-api-v2", "payment-api-v1"]
          timeline: "sprint-3"
          
  mobile_team:
    depends_on:
      - api_team:
          contracts: ["mobile-api-v1"]
          timeline: "sprint-4"
```

### 2. Communication Channels

Set up structured communication:

```yaml
# .simone/communication/channels.yml
communication:
  channels:
    daily_standup:
      time: "09:00 UTC"
      duration: "15min"
      participants: ["team-leads"]
      
    architecture_forum:
      frequency: "weekly"
      day: "Wednesday"
      participants: ["architects", "senior-devs"]
      
    sprint_review:
      frequency: "bi-weekly"
      participants: ["all-teams", "stakeholders"]
```

## Security and Compliance

### 1. Security Policies

Implement enterprise security standards:

```bash
# Configure security policies
claude-code "/project:simone:configure_security" \
  --secret-scanning="enabled" \
  --vulnerability-checks="automated" \
  --compliance-framework="SOC2" \
  --encryption="at-rest,in-transit"
```

### 2. Access Management

Set up role-based access control:

```yaml
# .simone/security/rbac.yml
rbac:
  roles:
    developer:
      permissions:
        - read: ["all-repos"]
        - write: ["dev-repos"]
        - execute: ["dev-pipelines"]
        
    lead:
      inherits: ["developer"]
      additional_permissions:
        - approve: ["pull-requests"]
        - manage: ["team-members"]
        
    architect:
      permissions:
        - read: ["all-repos"]
        - write: ["architecture-docs"]
        - approve: ["design-decisions"]
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### 1. Team Performance Metrics

Track key performance indicators:

```bash
# Set up performance tracking
claude-code "/project:simone:configure_metrics" \
  --track="velocity,quality,satisfaction" \
  --dashboard="enterprise" \
  --alerts="performance-degradation"
```

### 2. Project Health Monitoring

Monitor overall project health:

```yaml
# .simone/monitoring/health-checks.yml
health_checks:
  code_quality:
    metrics:
      - technical_debt_ratio: "< 15%"
      - code_coverage: "> 80%"
      - cyclomatic_complexity: "< 10"
      
  team_health:
    metrics:
      - sprint_completion_rate: "> 85%"
      - bug_escape_rate: "< 5%"
      - team_satisfaction: "> 4.0/5"
```

## Scaling Considerations

### 1. Repository Strategy

For large enterprises, consider:

- **Monorepo**: All teams in single repository with clear boundaries
- **Polyrepo**: Separate repositories per service/team
- **Hybrid**: Core platform monorepo with satellite service repos

### 2. Automation at Scale

Implement comprehensive automation:

```bash
# Set up enterprise automation
claude-code "/project:simone:setup_automation" \
  --ci-cd="full-pipeline" \
  --testing="automated" \
  --deployment="progressive-rollout" \
  --monitoring="comprehensive"
```

## Training and Support

### 1. Onboarding New Team Members

Create structured onboarding:

```yaml
# .simone/onboarding/new-developer.yml
onboarding_checklist:
  day_1:
    - Setup development environment
    - Access to repositories
    - Team introduction
    
  week_1:
    - Simone Framework training
    - First task assignment
    - Pair programming session
    
  month_1:
    - Complete starter project
    - Code review participation
    - Architecture overview
```

### 2. Continuous Learning

Establish learning programs:

```bash
# Create learning resources
claude-code "/project:simone:create_training" \
  --type="simone-advanced" \
  --format="interactive" \
  --track-progress="true"
```

## Common Patterns and Anti-Patterns

### Patterns for Success

1. **Regular Sync Points**: Daily standups, weekly planning
2. **Clear Ownership**: Every component has a designated owner
3. **Automated Everything**: CI/CD, testing, deployment
4. **Documentation First**: Write docs before implementation
5. **Incremental Adoption**: Start small, scale gradually

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Big Bang Migration**: Avoid converting everything at once
2. **Unclear Responsibilities**: Ensure clear ownership
3. **Manual Processes**: Automate repetitive tasks
4. **Siloed Teams**: Encourage cross-team collaboration
5. **Ignoring Metrics**: Track and act on performance data

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Initial Setup**: Follow the setup instructions above
2. **Run Pilot Project**: Start with a small team/project
3. **Gather Feedback**: Collect team input after first sprint
4. **Iterate and Improve**: Refine processes based on learnings
5. **Scale Gradually**: Expand to more teams as confidence grows
