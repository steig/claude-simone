# Workflow Improvements: Fixed /do_task Command

**Date**: 2025-07-10  
**Status**: Implemented  
**Priority**: Critical Bug Fix

## Problem Summary

The `/do_task` command had a **critical workflow flaw** that broke the entire development process:

### ❌ Original Issues
1. **Step 7**: Empty placeholder - no functionality
2. **Step 9**: Incomplete workflow - no PR creation
3. **Broken Chain**: Tasks completed but never integrated
4. **Manual Overhead**: Required manual PR creation and status updates

### ❌ Impact
- Completed tasks stayed isolated on feature branches
- No automatic PR creation for code review
- Manual workflow steps required for integration
- Broken development lifecycle management

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ Fixed Step 7: Implementation Quality Review

**New Functionality:**
- Pre-commit quality assessment
- Implementation results analysis
- Quality validation checks
- Preparation for user approval gates

### ✅ Fixed Step 9: Guided Task Completion with Approval Gates

**New Workflow:**
