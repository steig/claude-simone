# Release Management Workflow

Comprehensive guide for planning, preparing, and executing software releases using the Simone Framework.

## Overview

Release management in Simone ensures that software delivery is predictable, reliable, and traceable. This workflow covers everything from release planning through post-release monitoring, with emphasis on quality, communication, and risk management.

## Release Types

### Semantic Versioning

Simone follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

```yaml
version_scheme:
  major: "Breaking changes, major features"
  minor: "New features, backward compatible"
  patch: "Bug fixes, performance improvements"
  pre_release: "alpha, beta, rc"
  
examples:
  - "1.0.0": "Initial stable release"
  - "1.1.0": "New feature added"
  - "1.1.1": "Bug fix release"
  - "2.0.0": "Breaking API changes"
  - "2.1.0-beta.1": "Beta release for testing"
```

### Release Cadence

Define your release strategy:

```yaml
release_strategy:
  production_releases:
    frequency: "bi-weekly"
    day: "Tuesday"
    time: "10:00 UTC"
    
  hotfix_releases:
    sla: "within 24 hours"
    approval: "tech lead + product owner"
    
  feature_releases:
    trigger: "milestone completion"
    lead_time: "1 week"
    
  environments:
    - development: "continuous"
    - staging: "daily"
    - production: "bi-weekly"
```

## Release Planning

### Step 1: Create Release Plan

Create `.simone/02_REQUIREMENTS/RELEASE_v{VERSION}.md`:

```markdown
# Release Plan v1.2.0

## Release Overview
- **Version**: 1.2.0
- **Code Name**: "Thunder"
- **Target Date**: 2024-03-15
- **Release Manager**: Jane Doe
- **Type**: Minor Feature Release

## Release Scope

### Features
- [ ] TASK_045: User authentication system
- [ ] TASK_067: Payment integration
- [ ] TASK_089: Admin dashboard

### Bug Fixes
- [ ] BUG_012: Login timeout issue
- [ ] BUG_023: Payment calculation error

### Improvements
- [ ] TASK_101: Performance optimization
- [ ] TASK_102: Database query improvements

## Success Criteria
- All features tested and approved
- Performance benchmarks met
- Zero critical bugs
- Documentation updated
- Rollback plan tested
```

### Step 2: Dependency Check

Verify all dependencies:

```yaml
dependency_checklist:
  external_services:
    - service: "Payment Gateway API"
      version: "2.3.0"
      status: "verified"
    - service: "Email Service"
      version: "1.5.0"
      status: "verified"
      
  internal_dependencies:
    - component: "Auth Service"
      version: "1.0.0"
      status: "ready"
    - component: "Database Schema"
      version: "3.2.0"
      migration: "required"
      
  infrastructure:
    - requirement: "Redis 6.0+"
      status: "provisioned"
    - requirement: "Node.js 18+"
      status: "ready"
```

### Step 3: Risk Assessment

Document release risks:

```yaml
risk_assessment:
  high_risk:
    - risk: "Payment integration failure"
      impact: "Revenue loss"
      mitigation: "Feature flag with gradual rollout"
      rollback_time: "5 minutes"
      
  medium_risk:
    - risk: "Performance degradation"
      impact: "User experience"
      mitigation: "Load testing, monitoring alerts"
      rollback_time: "10 minutes"
      
  low_risk:
    - risk: "UI inconsistencies"
      impact: "Visual bugs"
      mitigation: "Cross-browser testing"
      rollback_time: "Next release"
```

## Pre-Release Preparation

### Code Freeze

1. **Announce Code Freeze**:
   ```markdown

## Release Retrospective

### Conduct Release Review

Create `.simone/10_STATE_OF_PROJECT/RELEASE_v1.2.0_Retrospective.md`:

```markdown
# Release v1.2.0 Retrospective

## Release Summary
- **Duration**: 45 minutes (planned: 60 minutes)
- **Issues**: 1 minor issue with cache clearing
- **Rollbacks**: None required
- **Downtime**: Zero (blue-green deployment)

## What Went Well
- Automated deployment worked flawlessly
- All pre-release testing caught issues early
- Communication was clear and timely
- Rollback plan not needed but ready

## What Could Improve
- Cache clearing script had minor bug
- Some documentation updates were last-minute
- Load testing could be more comprehensive

## Action Items
1. Fix cache clearing script for next release
2. Documentation freeze 2 days before release
3. Add more load testing scenarios
4. Create release automation for routine tasks

## Metrics
- Deployment time: 45 minutes âœ…
- Error rate spike: 0.3% (acceptable) âœ…
- Performance impact: +5% improvement âœ…
- User reports: 2 minor issues
```

### Update Release Process

Based on retrospective findings:

```yaml
process_improvements:
  - improvement: "Automate changelog generation"
    owner: "DevOps team"
    deadline: "Next sprint"
    
  - improvement: "Earlier documentation freeze"
    owner: "Tech writer"
    deadline: "Immediately"
    
  - improvement: "Enhanced load testing"
    owner: "QA team"
    deadline: "Before next release"
```

## Hotfix Process

### Emergency Release Workflow

For critical production issues:

1. **Assess Severity**:
   ```yaml
   severity_matrix:
     critical:
       criteria: "Data loss, security breach, complete outage"
       response: "Immediate hotfix"
       approval: "Any tech lead"
       
     high:
       criteria: "Major feature broken, significant performance issue"
       response: "Hotfix within 24 hours"
       approval: "Tech lead + PM"
       
     medium:
       criteria: "Minor feature issue, workaround available"
       response: "Next regular release"
       approval: "Standard process"
   ```

2. **Create Hotfix**:
   ```bash
   # Create hotfix branch
   git checkout -b hotfix/v1.2.1 v1.2.0
   
   # Fix issue
   # Test thoroughly
   # Create minimal changeset
   ```

3. **Fast-Track Testing**:
   - Focus on regression testing
   - Test specific fix thoroughly
   - Verify no side effects

4. **Deploy Hotfix**:
   - Use same deployment process
   - Enhance monitoring
   - Prepare immediate rollback

## Release Automation

### CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml
name: Release Pipeline

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
        
      - name: Test
        run: npm test
        
      - name: Security Scan
        run: npm audit
        
      - name: Create Release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
          body_path: CHANGELOG.md
          
      - name: Deploy
        run: ./deploy.sh production
        
      - name: Notify
        run: ./notify-release.sh ${{ github.ref }}
```

### Release Scripts

Automate common tasks:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# release.sh - Automated release script

VERSION=$1

# Update version
npm version $VERSION

# Generate changelog
conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s

# Run tests
npm test

# Build
npm run build

# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/v$VERSION

# Push
git push origin release/v$VERSION

echo "Release branch created. Please create PR for final review."
```

## Best Practices

### Planning Best Practices

1. **Release Early and Often**: Smaller, frequent releases are safer
2. **Feature Flags**: Decouple deployment from release
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Always maintain it when possible
4. **Communication**: Over-communicate release plans
5. **Automation**: Automate everything repeatable

### Execution Best Practices

1. **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime releases
2. **Gradual Rollout**: Start with small percentage
3. **Monitor Everything**: Watch metrics closely
4. **Quick Rollback**: Be ready to rollback fast
5. **Document Issues**: Keep detailed logs

### Post-Release Best Practices

1. **24-Hour Watch**: Enhanced monitoring period
2. **Gather Feedback**: Actively seek user input
3. **Quick Fixes**: Address issues immediately
4. **Retrospectives**: Always conduct them
5. **Process Improvement**: Continuously refine

## Metrics and KPIs

Track release metrics:

```yaml
release_metrics:
  deployment_frequency: "14 per month"
  lead_time: "3 days average"
  mttr: "15 minutes"  # Mean Time To Recovery
  change_failure_rate: "5%"
  
  release_quality:
    successful_releases: 95%
    hotfixes_required: 5%
    rollbacks: 2%
    customer_issues: "3 per release average"
    
  process_efficiency:
    automation_rate: 85%
    manual_steps: 3
    release_duration: "45 minutes average"
    documentation_completeness: 98%
```

---

Effective release management ensures reliable software delivery while minimizing risk and maximizing value delivery. By following these workflows and continuously improving the process, teams can achieve predictable, high-quality releases that delight users and maintain system stability.
