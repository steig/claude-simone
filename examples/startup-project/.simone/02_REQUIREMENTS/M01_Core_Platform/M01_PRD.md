## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
- Dashboard loads in <3 seconds on 3G connection
- API responses <500ms for 95% of requests
- Support 100 concurrent users during beta

### NFR2: Security
- All data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- OAuth scopes follow principle of least privilege
- Regular security scanning (weekly)

### NFR3: Reliability
- 99% uptime during business hours (9 AM - 6 PM EST)
- Automated backups daily
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

### NFR4: Usability

- Mobile-friendly responsive design

## Technical Constraints

### Technology Stack (Fixed)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 13 with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Hosting**: Vercel + Railway

### Integration Constraints
- Google Analytics API rate limits (10,000 requests/day)
- Stripe API rate limits (100 requests/second)
- Supabase row limits (500MB free tier)

### MVP Scope Limitations
- No real-time data (24-hour sync acceptable)
- No advanced analytics or ML features
- No team collaboration features
- No white-label or multi-tenant support

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### External Dependencies
- Google Analytics API availability and stability
- Stripe API availability and stability
- Supabase service reliability
- Email delivery service (integrated with Supabase)

### Business Assumptions
- Beta users willing to accept 24-hour data lag
- Simple metrics sufficient for initial validation
- Email reports adequate for initial engagement
- Manual customer support acceptable for beta

### Technical Assumptions
- Next.js 13 app router stable for production
- Supabase handles expected beta load
- OAuth integrations remain stable
- No major breaking changes in dependencies

## Success Criteria & Validation

### Milestone Success Criteria
1. **User Acquisition**: 100 beta users successfully register
2. **Feature Adoption**: 80% of users connect at least 1 data source
3. **Engagement**: 70% weekly active users during beta period
4. **Performance**: <3 second dashboard load times maintained
5. **Quality**: Zero critical bugs or security vulnerabilities

### Validation Methods
- **User Testing**: Weekly user interviews (5 users)
- **Analytics**: User behavior tracking with Mixpanel
- **Performance**: Lighthouse scores >90 for performance
- **Security**: Weekly security scans with Snyk
- **Business Metrics**: Weekly cohort analysis

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
1. **OAuth Integration Complexity** (Probability: 60%, Impact: 3 weeks delay)
   - **Mitigation**: Start with OAuth integration in week 1
   - **Contingency**: Simplified demo mode with sample data

2. **Performance at Scale** (Probability: 40%, Impact: 2 weeks delay)
   - **Mitigation**: Load testing with 500 concurrent users
   - **Contingency**: Upgrade Supabase plan or implement caching

### Medium Risks
1. **User Adoption Lower than Expected** (Probability: 30%, Impact: Business)
   - **Mitigation**: Weekly user feedback and iteration
   - **Contingency**: Pivot features based on user research

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases
1. **Week 1-2**: Authentication and user management
2. **Week 3-4**: Data source integrations (Google Analytics, Stripe)
3. **Week 5**: Dashboard and basic analytics
4. **Week 6**: Reporting and polish

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Jest for all business logic (80% coverage target)
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints and OAuth flows
- **E2E Tests**: Cypress for critical user journeys
