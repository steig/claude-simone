# Migration Project Example - Legacy Mainframe to Cloud Migration

This example demonstrates how to use the Simone Framework for **complex legacy system migration projects** with zero-downtime requirements and critical business continuity needs.

## 📋 Project Overview

**Project Type**: Legacy System Migration  
**Team Size**: 25 people across specialized teams  
**Duration**: 24 months  
**Systems**: 12 legacy mainframe systems  
**Migration Pattern**: Strangler Fig with Zero Downtime  
**Risk Level**: Critical (business-critical systems)  

## 🎯 What This Example Demonstrates

### Migration-Specific Features
- **Zero-Downtime Strategy**: Parallel systems with real-time synchronization
- **Legacy System Analysis**: Comprehensive discovery and documentation
- **Strangler Fig Pattern**: Gradual migration with incremental cutover
- **Business Continuity**: Maintaining operations throughout migration
- **Risk Management**: Critical risk assessment for business continuity

### Simone Framework for Migrations
- **Phase-Based Planning**: Analysis, development, migration, cutover phases
- **Legacy Documentation**: Comprehensive current state documentation
- **Migration Tracking**: Detailed progress tracking across 12 systems
- **Rollback Planning**: Comprehensive contingency and rollback procedures

## 🔄 Migration Characteristics

### Migration Strategy
- **Strangler Fig Pattern**: Gradually replace legacy functionality
- **Dual-Write Approach**: Synchronous writes to both systems
- **Incremental Cutover**: System-by-system migration approach
- **Real-Time Sync**: Continuous data synchronization during transition

### Risk Management
- **Business Continuity**: $10M/day downtime cost mitigation
- **Data Integrity**: 100% data accuracy validation
- **Performance**: Match or exceed current system performance
- **Rollback Capability**: 15-minute recovery time objective

### Legacy System Inventory
1. Customer Management (COBOL, DB2)
2. Order Processing (COBOL, IMS)
3. Inventory Management (PL/I, VSAM)
4. Financial Reporting (COBOL, DB2)
5. Billing System (COBOL, IMS)
6. Product Catalog (Assembler, VSAM)
7. Customer Service (COBOL, DB2)
8. Shipping & Logistics (COBOL, IMS)
9. Returns Processing (PL/I, VSAM)
10. Analytics & Reporting (SAS, DB2)
11. Security & Access Control (RACF, LDAP)
12. Batch Processing Engine (JCL, COBOL)

This example demonstrates how Simone Framework handles the complexity of large-scale legacy modernization while ensuring business continuity and risk mitigation.
